I have a lot of Linux stuff.

* Personal mail server on DigitalOcean (CentOS)
* Bare-metal server in my closet (Also CentOS)
* Desktop computers with Fedora
* Laptop with Arch Linux
* Used Gentoo Linux for about a year and maintained some packages in the official repositories
* Written several CLI applications that integrate well with Linux (UNIX philosphy, XDG standard for configuration, etc)
